          <h2>About Myself</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a
          bachelor in Mathematics. This is my first year attending Illinois
          Institute of Technology in hopes of getting a master degree in
          Information Technology and Management. My concentration is Data
          Management. I was raised in Rockford, Illinois but I currently live in
          South Elgin.

          My main goal in life is to become a data analyst for organizations that
          provide funding to help children go to school. During my time at the
          University of Illinois, I was fortunate enough to become a social
          committee for the Illinois Promise organization. This organization
          provided funding for students whose families have low income. I was
          honored to be friends with these students. I realize that families
          income should not become a barrier to a students path to achievement.
          Data management is the backbone that keeps organization like Illinois
          Promise alive because it keeps information of donors and donation
          trends. Therefore, my main goal in like is to provide creative and
          strategic advances to programs such as Illinois Promise.

          My interest in information management began during my time interning
          for a real estate company. With my math degree, I was asked to explore
          data pertaining to house searches, customers, and successful sales. I
          spent long hours looking at patterns and finding new correlations. I
          learned SQL on my own. I found a liking to data because of the many
          advances and improvements it can make. I will plan on achieving the
          skills required for data management at the Illinois Institute of
          Technology.

          Beside my experience with data, I also took a part time job as a tutor.
          With tutoring, I was to explain mathematics easily to those who have
          hard time at math. My tutoring skills ranged from elementary addition
          to calculus. With this advantage, I can easily explain difficult
          concepts in a simpler way which is critical for data analyst since they
          explain data in a simpler form in companies.
