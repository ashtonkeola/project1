            I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with
            a bachelor in Mathematics. This is my first year attending Illinois
            Institute of Technology in hopes of getting a master degree in
            Information Technology and Management. My concentration is Data
            Management. I was raised in Rockford, Illinois but I currently live
            in South Elgin.

          <p id ="text2">My main goal in life is to become a data analyst for
            organizations that provide funding to help children go to school.
            During my undergratuate years, I was fortunate
            enough to become a social committee that provided funding for
            students whose families have low income. I learned that families
            income should not become a barrier to a students path to
            achievement. Data management is the backbone that keeps these
            organization alive because it keeps information of donors and
            donation trends. Therefore, my main goal in like is to provide
            creative and strategic advances to programs such as Illinois
            Promise.</p>

          <p id="text3">My interest in information management began during my time interning
            for a real estate company. With my math degree, I was asked to
            explore data pertaining to house searches, customers, and successful
            sales. I spent long hours looking at patterns and finding new
            correlations. I learned SQL on my own. I found a liking to data
            because of the many advances and improvements it can make. I will
            plan on achieving the skills required for data management at the
            Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
