          <h2>United Way (Fall 2016)</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          I was fortunate enough to interview Theresa Merriman, the CFO of
          United Way of Rock Valley about data managing. United Way is a
          nonprofit organization that takes donations to improve the cityâ€™s
          education, health, and income. They have a database of donors. One of
          the biggest challenge right now is that their database contains
          records of names but no other information. One of the coworkers in
          charged of entering the data overlooked the requirements when adding
          new data. When I asked about what they do with those data, she said
          they just leave it alone. I also found it interesting that the
          database assumes that every donor is alive. Theresa commented that
          there are times where they contact donor but will receive complaints
          that the donor is deceased. (more here)

          <h2>Illinois Promise (2011-2015)</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          I was fortunate enough to be part of Illinois Promise, an organization
          that fund students in order to go to the University of Illinois at
          Urbana-Champaign. I became a social committee. My job was to get
          Illinois Promise Students involved in the organization and to show
          appreciation to their donation. I had a sucessful 30% increase in
          organization members.
